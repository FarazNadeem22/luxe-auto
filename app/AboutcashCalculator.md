## Program Description

This Python program allows users to manage and record cash deposits. It features user-friendly interactions, basic data validation, and automatic calculations.

## Functionality

* User selects a batch number (automatically generated on first run)
* User can create new entries by specifying month, day, person, department, and bill denominations (100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1)
* Entries are saved to a CSV file named after the batch number
* Batch can be closed, generating a new batch number automatically
* Program calculates total bills and amounts for each denomination and the overall total

## Code Structure

The program includes several functions:

* `clear_screen`: Clears the console screen based on the operating system.
* `get_batch_number`: Handles batch number generation and increments.
* `get_day`: Prompts the user for a valid day based on the selected month.
* `get_month`: Guides the user to select a month using input validation.
* `get_person_list`: Reads people names from a CSV file and returns a set.
* `get_person`: Asks the user to select a person from the available list.
* `dept_lst`: Reads department names from a CSV file and returns a set.
* `get_department`: Guides the user to select a department from the available list.
* `add_entry`: Takes user input for a new entry and creates a dictionary representing it.
* `menu`: Displays a menu with options for adding entries, closing the batch, getting a new batch number, or exiting the program.
* `append_entry_to_csv`: Saves the new entry dictionary to a CSV file.
* `get_csv_header`: Returns the header names for the CSV file.
* `take_action`: Handles user choices within the menu loop.
* `read_existing_data`: Reads an existing Excel file into a pandas DataFrame (not currently used).
* `calculate_bills`: Calculates and adds the total number of bills for each denomination to the CSV file.
* `calculate_amounts`: Calculates and adds the total amount for each denomination to the CSV file (needs revision).
* `calculate_total_amount`: Calculates and updates the total amount in the last row of the CSV file.
* `main`: Initializes the program, sets the initial batch number, and starts the user interaction loop.

## Notes

* The program uses CSV files for data storage. Consider switching to a database for larger datasets.
* The `calculate_amounts` function currently needs revision to correctly calculate the total amount.
* Consider adding features like editing or deleting entries and generating reports.
